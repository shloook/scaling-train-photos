## ‚ú® Key Features

Harness the latest in computer vision and deep learning to transform your images with simple commands or API calls:

* **Background Removal:** Instantly isolate subjects with high precision, ideal for e-commerce, graphic design, and clean cropping.
* **Object Detection & Replacement:** Intelligently identify specific objects (e.g., cars, faces, buildings) within a photo and seamlessly replace them using a text prompt (generative fill).
* **Style Transfer:** Apply the artistic style of a famous painting, photograph, or arbitrary image to your own photos.
* **Auto-Enhancement:** Intelligently adjust lighting, color, contrast, and sharpness for professional-grade photo quality with minimal input.
* **Scalable Core:** Built primarily with **TypeScript** for reliability and designed for easy integration into high-volume, production environments (e.g., cloud functions or dedicated microservices).

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need **Node.js** (which includes npm) installed on your system.

```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node -v
````

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shloook/scaling-train-photos.git](https://github.com/shloook/scaling-train-photos.git)
    cd scaling-train-photos
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Since the project is in TypeScript, we use npm to handle package installation.)*
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build the project:**
    *(Compile the TypeScript source code into executable JavaScript.)*
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## üíª Usage & Examples

The core functionality is contained within the `ai-photo-editor` directory. While we don't have the exact CLI commands, here is how you would conceptually use the project:

### 1\. Command Line Interface (CLI)

*(**NOTE:** Replace these conceptual commands with your actual CLI usage details.)*

| Feature | Conceptual Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remove Background** | `node dist/editor.js --action remove-bg --input image.jpg --output no_bg.png` | Generates a new image with a transparent background. |
| **Style Transfer** | `node dist/editor.js --action style --input photo.jpg --style style_img.jpg --output styled_photo.jpg` | Applies the artistic style of `style_img.jpg` to `photo.jpg`. |
| **Replace Object** | `node dist/editor.js --action replace --input scene.jpg --target "The blue car" --prompt "a red Ferrari" --output modified_scene.jpg` | Uses AI to replace a specific object in the image. |

### 2\. Developer Integration

For developers, you can import and use the AI functions directly into your Node.js or TypeScript application:

```typescript
// Example: Using the background removal function in a TypeScript project
import { removeBackground, applyStyleTransfer } from './ai-photo-editor/index';

// 1. Remove Background
async function processImage(inputPath: string, outputPath: string) {
    console.log(`Removing background from: ${inputPath}`);
    const resultPath = await removeBackground(inputPath, outputPath);
    console.log(`Result saved to: ${resultPath}`);
}

// 2. Apply Style Transfer
async function styleImage(inputPath: string, stylePath: string, outputPath: string) {
    console.log(`Applying style from ${stylePath}`);
    const resultPath = await applyStyleTransfer(inputPath, stylePath, outputPath);
    console.log(`Styled image saved to: ${resultPath}`);
}

// Example execution (assuming functions are correctly exported)
// processImage('path/to/input.jpg', 'path/to/output.png');
```
